            <p>
              Cards Against Society is a party game based on Cards Against Humanity in which players complete 
              fill-in-the-blank statements using words or phrases typically deemed as offensive, risqu√© or politically, incorrect printed on playing cards. 
              It has been compared to the 1999 card game Apples to Apples and originated from a Kickstarter campaign in 2011.
